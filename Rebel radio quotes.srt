1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,233
For those that forgot the roots of country music

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:06,800
this is rebel radio. 

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,633
Hey, Jesco

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,700
I've been listening  to your radio station. 

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,500
What the fuck are you talking about?

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,833
You sound like your fucked up on moonshine. 

7
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,800
What are you drinking in there? 

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Well, tonight, white whiskey 

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,066
It's not working here no more

10
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,533
You got to get to corn before the corn gets to cry 

11
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,266
or weeds don't grow. 

12
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:30,300
This is outlaw, hillbillies will rock your shit

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,700
Get your finger off my trigger cause it's hurry 

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,400
It might blow him kill both of us baby

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,733
Yeah. 

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,200
For those who think  country is gone soft.

17
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,466
Rebel Radio.

18
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,366
This fall you bees out there making that honey

19
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:32,133
If you're that sweet enough you can fly this way, honey

20
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:35,933
And you give us some your time to get in here and get your work done

21
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,033
and keep me covered i smoked one

22
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,966
which is a cigarets legal. 

23
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,833
Y'all are having a good  time out here, man.

24
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:26,333
How y'all doing out there? 

25
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,466
I'm pretty fucked up here, there in this studio. 

26
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:31,666
And I got one good one going on, man.

27
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,833
We've been partying all day right here. 

28
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,366
I ain't nobody  gonna fuck with the rebel radio 

29
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:40,933
Cause I'll back up all these legends and country heroes

30
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,566
Because country music  should fight the establishment, 

31
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:19,800
not become it. 

32
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,833
This is rebel radio

33
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,733
My daddy told me 

34
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,166
when I was a young boy. 

35
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,866
He said jesse if you're gonna get a buzz and get fucked up 

36
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,233
and get ripped out of the frame

37
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,600
It's best to do at home. 

38
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,333
That way you can save your money 

39
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,300
and get to do it tomorrow again. 

40
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,166
But if you go to jail, 

41
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,200
you're going to spend that money  you get out on. 

42
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,233
Then are you gonna have a hangover and broke for not listening to your daddy?

43
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:47,966
Mm hmm. 

44
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,133
Country music 

45
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,600
from before country turned into twangy pop sung by frat boys.

46
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,300
This is rebel radio

47
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,800
Have you ever huffed airplane glue?

48
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,233
seem like it take you higher and higher test

49
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,633
That would be a contest between them, too

50
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,633
one's got wings and one don't.  

51
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,000
and the one don't have wings say hi all time

52
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,533
no one's got wing crashes

53
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,100
Cause it run out of gas. 

54
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,166
That shit of fry you bring when the bag dries on your face, you pass out it man you're a goner

55
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,866
but the high tests keep you walking taller. 

56
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,600
Well the white liquor is the best cause it's first

57
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,933
but if it's over 180, it's ....

58
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,233
just better than all the rest of the regular liquor

59
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,266
And it's good whiskey, 

60
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,000
and it's guaranteed to kick butt

61
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,866
 that trees you gotta put juice with it

62
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:16,366
we put grape juice with it called purple jesus

63
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,800
And just because you play a guitar 

64
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,533
don't mean you got to be a sequin  where and said. 

65
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,433
Rebel radio. 

66
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,533
This is a radio station  for people like to party 

67
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,666
and build bomb farms like myself.

68
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,100
And I  will give you Jesco's  recipe for a good party. 

69
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,366
what you do: 

70
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:04,966
starts burning some old furniture you don't have no use for is just dirting up your yard

71
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:06,166
and put it on air 

72
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,900
And the fire will last all night long 

73
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,533
you'll get a better buzz instead of going out on the road

74
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,333
you got a taller together, man

75
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,100
you just start drinking and start rocking and have a ball

76
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:22,166
Because corporate country ain't country.

77
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,933
It's car break. 

78
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,433
Rebel radio.

79
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,700
And this is the stories  I want to really tell you. 

80
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,533
You people might believe in UFOs

81
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,600
and you might not. 

82
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,233
But seeing is believing. 

83
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,366
I had a barbecue cookout with my friends 

84
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:38,733
one went to the shit house

85
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,433
and I was on a break smoking me a good doobie

86
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,366
which was good as kicking skunk

87
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,633
And I was drinking some that clear water, man. 

88
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:49,633
and i saw handing were two people here and it was six steaks on the grill

89
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:50,900
I got the thinking

90
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
No wonder the mother f**kers up are shooting 

91
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,700
heat all six of them left me one at eight fur

92
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,533
Well, he comes back, I swore

93
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,466
and I pray my hand to God 

94
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:01,600
I did not steal  the rest of those steaks. 

95
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,066
Asked him why you had to go shit for.

96
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:06,133
He says, I promise.  Jesco, I'm your buddy

97
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,766
I do not steal all the steaks

98
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,766
Hey, something going on here ain't right. 

99
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:11,633
But the alien had stolen them, 

100
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm gonna go track that son of a bitch down

101
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,966
 to find him  that eat my steaks and stole them without asking

102
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:21,133
I'm gonna butcher him up like one and fry his ass

103
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,900
I get out in the woods.  I'm for life 

104
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,833
and I'm all I'm pissed off  because my steaks has gone. 

105
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,266
I had to pay big money for as a dog.

106
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,900
Who's that son of a bitch 

107
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,100
who got my goddamn steaks? 

108
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,200
He looks back at me and that shit.

109
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,033
He said, Hey, 

110
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,966
you look like  you really want to stick me. 

111
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,066
Oh, I did. 

112
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:42,233
Cause I can't eat you  unless I get you on the far and cook you 

113
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,033
like that he jumps over in the weeds. 

114
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:48,133
stay out and be carried out ain't nothing this hollow worth dying for us they ought to be carried out

115
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:49,266
No trespassing.

116
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:31,000
This is  my advice on how to please a woman.

117
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,733
Don't ever argue with him 

118
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:35,300
because you won't have a chance get your word in. 

119
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,166
And three times  a husband don't have a chance. 

120
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,000
Sex, drugs and money. 

121
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,700
That's all a woman lives for. 

122
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,300
This station is a mind blowing. 

123
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,433
And it takes you  from sadness to happiness. 

124
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,366
And it's a guarantee  to blow your mind. 

125
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:50,566
cause jessica feels your heart full of love, and a man full of joy

126
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:53,933
Because when you do see something that pretty you're walking off leaving

127
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,166
you will miss it. 

128
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,933
But you won't forget him when he throws his hand back to you. 

129
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:00,300
it is cool as hell man

130
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,300
it's like letting your horse out of the barn ain't there

131
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,866
you just hear the horse trotting

132
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:08,366
and it's me. 

133
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,000
You never conform.

134
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,533
Rebel Radio. 

135
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,533
when you got the shits down here

136
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,300
in these part of the country's man

137
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,700
north,  south, west to east or west,

138
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,966
this is the best way to cure  your balance and get them unlocked

139
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,100
Go out 

140
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,233
and get the biggest tree you can find if you can get your arms around and make sure you do 

141
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:59,766
because you want to hold your hands on the other side

142
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:02,866
and take ten deep breaths and squeeze that tree 

143
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:04,566
just as hard as you can. 

144
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:07,300
Then let it out and I guarantee you

145
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,800
you'll shit  dislocate your newborn baby. 

146
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,133
it's the best way to relieve you balance of in law. 

147
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,300
He can't find the key.

148
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
叛逆电台

149
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,333
the home of gun control

150
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:04,300
progressive politics and break dancing

151
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:08,566
All of you radio listeners out there

152
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:09,600
horror of yet 

153

154
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,400
and you feel less pain. 

155
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,533
And I guarantee you 

156
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,333
you can dance and sing and be the happiest person on the planet. 

157
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,133
It don't matter who you are. 

158
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,133
Whatever you do is your business. 

159
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:27,700
If it makes you happy, do it.

160
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,133
Well, turn it up on rebel radio. 

161
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:00,066
We love you to death 

162

because I was born to be war 

163
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,366
as a rebel child without any calls.

164
00:39:04,366 --> 00:39:06,766
And I'm drinking  whatever is in front of me. 

165
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,500
cause she left the note on a door

166
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,700
You sleeping on the porch? You come home drunk one more time

167
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,766
Yes. And good country music going on.

168
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:16,233
And I guarantee  you going to love this station. 

169
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,500
This is Rebel Radio, Bless your soul. 

170
00:41:14,233 --> 00:41:16,300
Wheel country

171
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,366
Rebel radio.

172
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:21,233
Well, my daddy told me one time, 

173
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,533
he said, Son,  you got two heads, 

174
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,766
one between your legs and one on your shoulders. 

175
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:27,700
And one of them got a lack of sense. 

176
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,233
And I said, You know why, Daddy? 

177
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,033
he says well son

178
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,366
That’s because i'm living with two nuts

179
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,266
right around the  corner from an asshole.

180
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:48,633
Because country is go secede

181
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:50,800
Rebel radio

182
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,266
i huffed enough gas 

183
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:55,933
filled my rocket ship three times power from the space shuttle

184
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,000
and a smoke more in the train

185
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,933
had hauls out to black gold 

186
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:02,666
which keeps the lights on in my home 

187
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:04,133
and food on the table 

188
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:05,333
and shoes on my feet, 

189
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:06,666
the code on my back. 

190
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,100
And that's all I get to say, 

191
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,900
because that's all I've got left. 

192
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,100
I had a tumor 

193
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,400
on the right side of my brain 

194
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,966
and a blood clot on the left. 

195
00:46:48,966 --> 00:46:50,466
And I told the doctor 

196
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:52,100
that I had appointment with. 

197
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,266
He says,  There's not much we can do for you 

198
00:46:54,266 --> 00:46:56,600
that we can help you with. 

199
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,200
He said,  because I tell you why, 

200
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,600
going in on your brain is a dangerous operation. 

201
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,533
It's a 50/50 chance you might stay and you might get to come back

202
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:05,866
I said, Well, 

203
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,433
if you can‘t help me, Doctor, 

204
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,766
why can't I be my doctor  and help myself 

205
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:11,233
and smoke me a miracle 

206
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:14,166
joint called the Miracle Pot Marijuana. 

207
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:17,966
And I smoked that joint which held it in my lungs 

208
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:21,700
and it took oxygen to my brain. Get the tumor, the munchies. 

209
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,833
And he slides over on the left side 

210
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,166
and needs to blood clot up 

211
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,700
and then I get better. 

212
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,333
We got this good contribution that we're already going out of here

213
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,233
because we're not stoned to the fact.  

214
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:35,000
You all people think we're ripped out of frame, sound funny? 

215
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,566
Give me a good rebel yell. 

216
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:38,200
Hell, yeah.

217
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,833
Rebel radio

218
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:10,700
Hope y'all getting crazy out here 

219
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,566
because I'm really getting fucked up 

220
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:13,933
and ripped out of the frame. 

221
00:50:13,933 --> 00:50:15,633
I'm 20,000 years old, 

222
00:50:15,633 --> 00:50:17,000
so how could I be wrong? 

223
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Months a drunk assholes. 

224
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,500
You're going to wake up and wonder what the fuck happened to you? 

225
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,700
With rebel radio with Jesco

226
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,500
Now, how could I be right  if I'm wrong? 

227
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,100
And this is Rebel radio.

228
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,900
I'm going to tell you what I'm going to put on my tombstone. 

229
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,766
No more pussy alley. 

230
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,433
No more whiskey I'll drink. 

231
00:53:31,433 --> 00:53:33,366
On your tombstone, you will read. 

232
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:34,266
Here lies a legend 

233
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:37,300
One of a kind with that rebel calls out of calls

234
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,933
land called Under the Dust. 

235
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:38,533
I rob some grocery stores

236
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:39,933
I thought it was a thrill 

237
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:41,600
because they had what I wanted. 

238
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,533
I couldn't find it.  So I went in and took it. 

239
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:46,133
And just to get high on, you know 

240
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:48,333
what I'm saying  to get a buzz was lighter flooded

241
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,666
which was hooked on there like the gas, too. 

242
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,133
So when the store was robbed, 

243
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:54,666
they found the whole case lighter fluid going. 

244
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,366
They know that I stole it cause 

245
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:58,100
I took a whole case over 

246
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,600
so I'd have enough to do me, 

247
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,566
which was 24 cans 

248
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,300
and not enough account a day 

249
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,800
to get the full flick vouchers  I needed. 

250
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,166
And that's how I become in trouble. 

251
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:11,366
So i've done my time, learned from that not to do it again. 

252
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,766
There ain't much of a squirrel,  but I'll tell you, 

253
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:15,633
they're damn good eating. 

254
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,900
And you can get one leg of the squirrels.  You got a bite, 

255
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,700
which is really good. But the brain part of the squirrel 

256
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,566
has better than a whole squirrel. 

257
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:27,233
I call it soul  food for the hillbillies.

258
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:30,800
And you  can also take their town saddle as a roach clip 

259
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,433
as you smoke Mary Jane. 

260
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:36,166
This is Rebel Radio
